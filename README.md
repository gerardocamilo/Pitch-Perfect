# Pitch Perfect

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains my implementation for the Pitch Perfect project - Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

This app uses AVFoundation to record a conversation and allows to play the audio back with filters applied to create different funny voices. 

Stack Views are used to better organise components on the Play Sounds View Controller Scene.

Contains a programmatically triggered segue.

Implements the Delegate pattern to determine when the audio has been recorded and properly saved in order to display the player view. 

Disclaimer: PlaySoundsViewController+Audio.swift file was provided by Udacity.
